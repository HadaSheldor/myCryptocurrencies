This project has been submitted as part of of a Full Stack Developer programme.

The project supports Single Page Application (SPA).

Javascript runs in client-side, containing Ajax requests to coingecko API.

The project's objective is to present an up-to-date information about Cryptocurrencies. 

Homepage includes Cryptocurrency's: Name, Symbol, Image, and Current Price (in USD, EUR, and ILS).            

Once mapped, data has been stored locally (client-side) in order to accelerate page loading, yet, since market data changes frequently, storing has been limitted to a timeframe of two minutes in order to invoke a new data request.

The project allows users to select up to 5 cryptocurrencies for Live Reports.

Live reports display multi-axes live charts, using jQuery's canvas.js.
